After model enlargement:
    The model core has 64 species and 426 reactions
    The model edge has 2290 species and 1022 reactions


Removing 95 edge reactions that aren't useful
Adding 429 new RMG reactions to be checked.
In total will check 429 edge reactions
against 7839 unmatched chemkin reactions.

After model enlargement:
    The model core has 80 species and 506 reactions
    The model edge has 4174 species and 1996 reactions


Removing 281 edge reactions that aren't useful
Adding 957 new RMG reactions to be checked.
In total will check 957 edge reactions
against 7690 unmatched chemkin reactions.
Chemkin reaction     C2H5OO + CH3COCH3 => C2H5OOH + CH3COCH2
 matches RMG reaction  C2H5OOH(17) + CH3COCH2(1838) <=> CCO[O](280) + CH3COCH3(1683)

After model enlargement:
    The model core has 84 species and 555 reactions
    The model edge has 4535 species and 1411 reactions


Removing 363 edge reactions that aren't useful
Adding 182 new RMG reactions to be checked.
In total will check 182 edge reactions
against 7643 unmatched chemkin reactions.
Chemkin reaction     IC4H9P-OO => IC4P-QOOH
 matches RMG reaction  C[C](C)COO(4457) <=> IC4H9P-OO(3141)
 suggesting new species match: {'IC4P-QOOH': 'C[C](C)COO(4457)'}
Chemkin reaction     IC4P-QOOH => IC4H9P-OO
 matches RMG reaction  C[C](C)COO(4457) <=> IC4H9P-OO(3141)
