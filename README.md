This repository contains the Python version of Reaction Mechanism Generator 
(RMG), a tool for automatically generating kinetic models of chemical reaction
mechanisms, and related projects. RMG is developed primarily by researchers in 
[Prof. William Green's research group](http://web.mit.edu/greengp/) at the 
[Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://web.mit.edu/) 
and [Prof. Richard West's research group](http://www.northeastern.edu/comocheng/) at 
[Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/). 

The most official repository is at https://github.com/GreenGroup/RMG-Py.
There are some instructions at  http://greengroup.github.com/RMG-Py/ including
details on [how to install RMG-Py](http://greengroup.github.com/RMG-Py/users/rmg/installation/index.html)
and its numerous dependencies.

We have a continuous integration build test suite 
which you can access at https://travis-ci.org/GreenGroup/RMG-Py
The current build status is
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GreenGroup/RMG-Py.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GreenGroup/RMG-Py)

Details of the (earlier established) Java version of RMG can be found
on [Sourceforge](http://rmg.sourceforge.net/) (although it too is 
developed [here on github](https://github.com/GreenGroup/RMG-Java/)).
